Bench Press
<p>Lay down on a bench, the bar should be directly above your eyes, the knees are somewhat angled and the feet are firmly on the floor. Concentrate, breath deeply and grab the bar more than shoulder wide. Bring it slowly down till it briefly touches your chest at the height of your nipples. Push the bar up.</p>
<p>If you train with a high weight it is advisable to have a <em>spotter</em> that can help you up if you can't lift the weight on your own.</p>
<p>With the width of the grip you can also control which part of the chest is trained more:</p>
<ul>
<li>wide grip: outer chest muscles</li>
<li>narrow grip: inner chest muscles and triceps</li>
</ul>

Benchpress Dumbbells
<p>The movement is very similar to benchpressing with a barbell, however, the weight is brought down to the chest at a lower point.</p>
<p>Hold two dumbbells and lay down on a bench. Hold the weights next to the chest, at the height of your nipples and press them up till the arms are stretched. Let the weight slowly and controlled down.</p>

Bench Press Narrow Grip
<p>Lay down on a bench, the bar is directly over your eyes, the knees form a slight angle and the feet are firmly on the ground. Hold the bar with a narrow grip (around 20cm.). Lead the weight slowly down till the arms are parallel to the floor (elbow: right angle), press then the bar up. When bringing the bar down, don't let it down on your nipples as with the regular bench pressing, but somewhat lower.</p>

Bent-over Lateral Raises
<p>Sit on bench while holding weights. Bend forward as far as possible, with arms slightly bent at the elbow. Perform a lateral raise while maintaining the bend in your elbow.</p>

Close-grip Bench Press
<p>Perform a typical bench press, but hold the bar with your hands approximately shoulder-width apart and keep your elbows close to your body.</p>

Crunches
<p>Lay down on your back a soft surface, the feet are on the floor. Ask a partner or use some other help (barbell, etc.) to keep them fixed, your hands are behind your head. From this position move your upper body up till your head or elbows touch your knees. Do this movement by rolling up your back.</p>

Decline Press Sit-Up
<ol>
<li>Lie down on a bench with a barbell resting on your chest. Position your legs so they are secure on the extension of the abdominal bench.</li>
<li>While inhaling, tighten your abdominals and glutes. Simultaneously curl your torso as you do when performing a sit-up and press the barbell to an overhead position while exhaling. </li>
<li>Lower your upper body back down to the starting position while bringing the barbell back down to your torso. Remember to breathe in while lowering the body.</li>
</ol>
<p>Caution: It is best to have a spotter while performing this exercise so that it is easier to get the barbell and also get rid of it. Also, always start with an empty bar and do not use jerking motions at any time.</p>
<p> </p>

Diagonal Shoulder Press
<p>You sit at the bench press device, back slightly tilted to the back. The bar should be about 20 cm in front of you. Then you push the bar and take it back again, as you would with a bench press.</p>
<p>In this position you strain your chest muscles a lot less, which is nice if you want to train, but your chest hasn't recovered yet.</p>
<p>Here's a link to a girl on a machine specialized for this exercise, to give a better description than my failing words above.</p>

Fly With Dumbbells, Decline Bench
<p>The exercise is the same as with a regular bench:</p>
<p>Take two dumbbells and lay on a bench, make sure the feet are firmly on the ground and your back is not arched, but has good contact with the bench. The arms are stretched in front of you, about shoulder wide. Bend now the arms a bit and let them down with a half-circle movement to the side. Without changing the angle of the elbow bring them in a fluid movement back up.</p>

French Press (skullcrusher) Dumbbells
<p>Hold the dumbbells and lay down on a flat bench in such a way that around 1/4 of your head is over the edge. Stretch your arms with the weights and bend them so that the dumbbells are lowered (make sure they don't touch each other). Just before they touch your forehead, push them up.</p>
<p>Pay attention to your elbows and arms: only the triceps are doing the work, the rest of the arms should not move.</p>

Front Raises
<p>To execute the exercise, the lifter stands with their feet shoulder width apart and weights or resistance handles held by their side with a pronated (overhand) grip.</p>
<p>The movement is to bring the arms up in front of the body to eye level and with only a slight bend in the elbow. This isolates the anterior deltoid muscle (front of the shoulder) and uses the anterior deltoid to lift the weight.</p>
<p>When lifting it is important to keep the body still so the anterior deltoid is fully utilised; if the weight cannot be lifted by standing still then it is too heavy and a lower weight is needed. It is important to keep a slight bend in the elbow when lifting as keeping the elbow locked will add stress to the elbow joint and could cause injury.</p>
<p>A neutral grip, similar to that used in the hammer curl, can also be used. With this variation the weight is again raised to eye level, but out to a 45 degree angle from the front of the body. This may be beneficial for those with shoulder injuries, particularly those related to the rotator cuff.</p>

Hammercurls
<p>Hold two dumbbells and sit on a bench with a straight back, the shoulders are slightly rolled backwards. Your pals point to your body. Bend the arms and bring the weight up with a fast movement. Don't rotate your hands, as with the curls. Without any pause bring the dumbbell down with a slow, controlled movement.</p>
<p>Don't swing your body during the exercise, the biceps should do all the work here. The elbows are at your side and don't move.</p>

Incline Dumbbell Flye
<p>Use inclined bench. Hold dumbbells straight out to your sides, elbows slightly bent. Bring arms together above you, keeping angle of elbows fixed.</p>

<li>Pause at the top of the motion, and then return to the starting position.</li>
</ol>

Lateral Raises
<p>.</p>

Lateral-to-Front Raises
<p>-(1) Perform a lateral raise, pausing at the top of the lift (2).</p>
<p>-Instead of lowering the weight, bring it to the front of your body so that you appear to be at the top position of a front raise.  You will do this by using a Pec Fly motion, maintaining straight arms. (3)</p>
<p>-Now lower the weight to your quadriceps, or, in other words, lower the dumbbells as though you are completing a Front Raise repetition. (4)</p>
<p>-Reverse the motion:  Perform a front raise (5), at the apex of the lift use a Reverse Fly motion to position the weights at the top of a Lateral Raise (6), and finally, lower the weights until your palms are essentially touching the sides of your thighs (7).  THIS IS ONE REP.</p>
<p>(1) l  <em>front view  </em>(2) -l- <em> FV  </em>  (3) l-  <em>side view</em>   (4) l  <em>SV/FV</em>   (5) l-  <em>SV  </em> (6) -l-  <em>FV  </em>  (7)  l  <em>FV/SV</em></p>

Seated Triceps Press
<p>Sit down on a back (better with back support). Take a dumbbell firmly with both hands and hold it with extended arms over your head. With your palms facing upward and holding the weight of the dumbbell, slowly lower the weight behind your head.</p>
<p> </p>

Shoulder Press, Dumbbells
<p>Sit on a bench, the back rest should be almost vertical. Take two dumbbells and bring them up to shoulder height, the palms and the elbows point during the whole exercise to the front. Press the weights up, at the highest point they come very near but don't touch. Go slowly down and repeat.</p>

Shrugs, Dumbbells
<p>Stand with straight body, the hands are hanging freely on the side and hold each a dumbbell. Lift from this position the shoulders as high as you can, but don't bend the arms during the movement. On the highest point, make a short pause of 1 or 2 seconds before returning slowly to the initial position.</p>
<p>When training with a higher weight, make sure that you still do the whole movement!</p>

Side Dumbbell Trunk Flexion
<p>AKA dumbbell side bends. Stand in line with the hips with slightly bent knees, maintain the natural curvature of the spine, hand stretched by the body, grip the barbell with one hand. <em> </em>Make slow and controlled torso side flexions till you reach the angle of approximately 45°.</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with a dumbbell in each hand and your palms facing your torso. Keep your back straight with a slight bend in the knees and bend forward at the waist. Your torso should be almost parallel to the floor. Make sure to keep your head up. Your upper arms should be close to your torso and parallel to the floor. Your forearms should be pointed towards the floor as you hold the weights. There should be a 90-degree angle formed between your forearm and upper arm. This is your starting position.</li>
<li>Now, while keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and use your triceps to lift the weights until the arm is fully extended. Focus on moving the forearm.</li>
<li>After a brief pause at the top contraction, inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.</li>
<li>Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Variations:</strong> This exercise can be executed also one arm at a time much like the one arm rows are performed.</p>
<p>Also, if you like the one arm variety, you can use a low pulley handle instead of a dumbbell for better peak contraction. In this case, the palms should be facing up (supinated grip) as opposed to the torso (neutral grip).</p>
