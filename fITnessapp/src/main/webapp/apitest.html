Axe Hold
<p>Grab dumbbells and extend arms to side and hold as long as you can</p>

Benchpress Dumbbells
<p>The movement is very similar to benchpressing with a barbell, however, the weight is brought down to the chest at a lower point.</p>
<p>Hold two dumbbells and lay down on a bench. Hold the weights next to the chest, at the height of your nipples and press them up till the arms are stretched. Let the weight slowly and controlled down.</p>

<p>Bend over slightly while holding two dumbbells.  Pull the dumbbells up to your chest, keeping your elbows as high as you can.</p>

Bentover Dumbbell Rows
<p>With dumbbells in hand, bend at the hip until hands hang just below the knees (similar to straight-legged-deadlift starting position). Keep upper body angle constant while contracting your lats to pull you ellbows back pinching the shoulder blades at the top. Try not to stand up with every rep, check hands go below knees on every rep.</p>

<p>Hold two barbells, the arms are streched, the hands are on your side, the palms face inwards. Bend the arms and bring the weight with a fast movement up. At the same time, rotate your arms by 90 degrees at the very beginning of the movement. At the highest point, rotate a little the weights further outwards. Without a pause, bring them down, slowly.</p>
<p>Don't allow your body to swing during the exercise, all work is done by the biceps, which are the only mucles that should move (pay attention to the elbows).</p>

Fly With Dumbbells
<p>Take two dumbbells and lay on a bench, make sure the feet are firmly on the ground and your back is not arched, but has good contact with the bench. The arms are stretched in front of you, about shoulder wide. Bend now the arms a bit and let them down with a half-circle movement to the side. Without changing the angle of the elbow bring them in a fluid movement back up.</p>

Fly With Dumbbells, Decline Bench
<p>The exercise is the same as with a regular bench:</p>
<p>Take two dumbbells and lay on a bench, make sure the feet are firmly on the ground and your back is not arched, but has good contact with the bench. The arms are stretched in front of you, about shoulder wide. Bend now the arms a bit and let them down with a half-circle movement to the side. Without changing the angle of the elbow bring them in a fluid movement back up.</p>

French Press (skullcrusher) Dumbbells
<p>Hold the dumbbells and lay down on a flat bench in such a way that around 1/4 of your head is over the edge. Stretch your arms with the weights and bend them so that the dumbbells are lowered (make sure they don't touch each other). Just before they touch your forehead, push them up.</p>
<p>Pay attention to your elbows and arms: only the triceps are doing the work, the rest of the arms should not move.</p>

Front Raises
<p>To execute the exercise, the lifter stands with their feet shoulder width apart and weights or resistance handles held by their side with a pronated (overhand) grip.</p>
<p>The movement is to bring the arms up in front of the body to eye level and with only a slight bend in the elbow. This isolates the anterior deltoid muscle (front of the shoulder) and uses the anterior deltoid to lift the weight.</p>
<p>When lifting it is important to keep the body still so the anterior deltoid is fully utilised; if the weight cannot be lifted by standing still then it is too heavy and a lower weight is needed. It is important to keep a slight bend in the elbow when lifting as keeping the elbow locked will add stress to the elbow joint and could cause injury.</p>
<p>A neutral grip, similar to that used in the hammer curl, can also be used. With this variation the weight is again raised to eye level, but out to a 45 degree angle from the front of the body. This may be beneficial for those with shoulder injuries, particularly those related to the rotator cuff.</p>

Hammercurls
<p>Hold two dumbbells and sit on a bench with a straight back, the shoulders are slightly rolled backwards. Your pals point to your body. Bend the arms and bring the weight up with a fast movement. Don't rotate your hands, as with the curls. Without any pause bring the dumbbell down with a slow, controlled movement.</p>
<p>Don't swing your body during the exercise, the biceps should do all the work here. The elbows are at your side and don't move.</p>

Incline Dumbbell Flye
<p>Use inclined bench. Hold dumbbells straight out to your sides, elbows slightly bent. Bring arms together above you, keeping angle of elbows fixed.</p>

Incline Dumbbell Press
<ul>
<li>Bench should be angled anywhere from 30 to 45 degrees</li>
<li>Be sure to press dumbbells straight upward (perpendicular to the floor)</li>
</ul>

Incline Dumbbell Row
<ol>
<li>Using a neutral grip, lean into an incline bench.</li>
<li>Take a dumbbell in each hand with a neutral grip, beginning with the arms straight. This will be your starting position.</li>
<li>Retract the shoulder blades and flex the elbows to row the dumbbells to your side.</li>
<li>Pause at the top of the motion, and then return to the starting position.</li>
</ol>

Lateral Raises
<p>.</p>

Lateral-to-Front Raises
<p>-(1) Perform a lateral raise, pausing at the top of the lift (2).</p>
<p>-Instead of lowering the weight, bring it to the front of your body so that you appear to be at the top position of a front raise.  You will do this by using a Pec Fly motion, maintaining straight arms. (3)</p>
<p>-Now lower the weight to your quadriceps, or, in other words, lower the dumbbells as though you are completing a Front Raise repetition. (4)</p>
<p>-Reverse the motion:  Perform a front raise (5), at the apex of the lift use a Reverse Fly motion to position the weights at the top of a Lateral Raise (6), and finally, lower the weights until your palms are essentially touching the sides of your thighs (7).  THIS IS ONE REP.</p>
<p>(1) l  <em>front view  </em>(2) -l- <em> FV  </em>  (3) l-  <em>side view</em>   (4) l  <em>SV/FV</em>   (5) l-  <em>SV  </em> (6) -l-  <em>FV  </em>  (7)  l  <em>FV/SV</em></p>

Seated Triceps Press
<p>Sit down on a back (better with back support). Take a dumbbell firmly with both hands and hold it with extended arms over your head. With your palms facing upward and holding the weight of the dumbbell, slowly lower the weight behind your head.</p>
<p> </p>

Shoulder Press, Dumbbells
<p>Sit on a bench, the back rest should be almost vertical. Take two dumbbells and bring them up to shoulder height, the palms and the elbows point during the whole exercise to the front. Press the weights up, at the highest point they come very near but don't touch. Go slowly down and repeat.</p>

Shrugs, Dumbbells
<p>Stand with straight body, the hands are hanging freely on the side and hold each a dumbbell. Lift from this position the shoulders as high as you can, but don't bend the arms during the movement. On the highest point, make a short pause of 1 or 2 seconds before returning slowly to the initial position.</p>
<p>When training with a higher weight, make sure that you still do the whole movement!</p>

<p>Sit on the preacher curl bench and perform a bicep curl with a dumbbell in one hand. Your other hand can be at rest, or beneath your curling arm's elbow.</p>

Tricep Dumbbell Kickback
<ol>
<li>Start with a dumbbell in each hand and your palms facing your torso. Keep your back straight with a slight bend in the knees and bend forward at the waist. Your torso should be almost parallel to the floor. Make sure to keep your head up. Your upper arms should be close to your torso and parallel to the floor. Your forearms should be pointed towards the floor as you hold the weights. There should be a 90-degree angle formed between your forearm and upper arm. This is your starting position.</li>
<li>Now, while keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and use your triceps to lift the weights until the arm is fully extended. Focus on moving the forearm.</li>
<li>After a brief pause at the top contraction, inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.</li>
<li>Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Variations:</strong> This exercise can be executed also one arm at a time much like the one arm rows are performed.</p>
<p>Also, if you like the one arm variety, you can use a low pulley handle instead of a dumbbell for better peak contraction. In this case, the palms should be facing up (supinated grip) as opposed to the torso (neutral grip).</p>
